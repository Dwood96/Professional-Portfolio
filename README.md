Professional Portfolio to demonstrate capabilities with a variety of software and methodologies

In this repository you will find a variety of projects that show my abilities to use a multitude of software that such as R, SQL and Tableau. 

You can find my Tableau projects here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/douglas.wood

For R you can find a Jupyter Notebbok where I use ANOVA and ANCOVA to analyse the NYCflights Dataset.

You can also find some SQL scripts demonstrating my capabilities with SQL where I query some data containign information about the COVID-19 Pandemic.
